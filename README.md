# Rankup
This is my last project that is inspired of Facebook, Instagram and HotOrNot.
Now it have about 35 daily users and there are increasing :)

For Rankup developing proccess I used Android Studio as main developing product for writing code and designing the app.
Photoshop was help-hand for designing.
The main logic of the app is going around Firebase Database where I am storing users information in the server-side and connecting
them in client-side.
I improve performance of the app multiple times by using Piccasso libraries for handling image downloading and set to ImageViews.

There are multiple Rank-lists based on users post likes and user likes. Each user have a profile activity with their information, 
they are allowed to write post comments and see who have liked posts as well. The app provides many opportunities.

Here is the link of Rankup in Google Play! You can test it for free!
